description: Settle in for a stiff dose of daring and danger in Jackson Gregory's
  classic Man to Man. Protagonist Steve Packard comes from a long line of rough-and-tumble
  men who make decisions at the drop of a hat, and when he gets the urge to put his
  career as a sailor on hold and travel to his childhood stomping, he doesn't stop
  to question it -- he just goes. But giving into this nostalgic impulse may be the
  worst mistake in the long line of blunders that is his life. Will he make it out
  alive?
